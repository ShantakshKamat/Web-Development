    <h1>Computer Organization</h1>

    <h4>
    Computer architecture refers to those attributes of a system visible to a programmer
    or, put another way, those attributes that have a direct impact on the
    logical execution of a program.

    A term that is often used interchangeably with computer
    architecture is instruction set architecture (ISA). The ISA defines instruction
    formats, instruction opcodes, registers, instruction and data memory; the effect of
    executed instructions on the registers and memory; and an algorithm for controlling
    instruction execution.

    Computer organization refers to the operational units
    and their interconnections that realize the architectural specifications. Examples of
    architectural attributes include the instruction set, the number of bits used to represent
    various data types (e.g., numbers, characters), I/O mechanisms, and techniques
    for addressing memory. Organizational attributes include those hardware details
    transparent to the programmer, such as control signals; interfaces between the computer
    and peripherals; and the memory technology used.
